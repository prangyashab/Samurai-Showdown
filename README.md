# Samurai Showdown! 🗡️

Hi! This is my game called Samurai Showdown. It is really cool and I worked super hard on it!

## How to Play 🎮
You are a super strong samurai hero! You have to fight the bad guys to win the levels. There are 50 whole levels to beat!

### Controls for Computer:
- **Move around:** Use the Left and Right arrows! ⬅️ ➡️
- **Jump high:** Press the Up arrow! ⬆️
- **Super Fast Dash:** Press the Down arrow to zoom across the screen! ⬇️
- **Smack 'em:** Hit the Spacebar to swing your shiny sword! ⚔️
- **RAGE MODE:** When your blue energy bar gets completely full, press SHIFT and your sword glows! You will do DOUBLE damage! 💥

### On Your Phone! 📱
You can play it on your phone too! Just hold your phone sideways and tap the big colorful buttons on the screen to run and fight!

## Cool Secret Stuff ✨
- If your mom calls you or you have to go do homework, don't worry! Just switch to another tab or minimize the window and the game will auto-pause all by itself so the bad guys don't get you! 
- If the music is too loud, just click the gear on the home screen or open the pause menu to slide the volume down.
- If it's too hard, you can change the difficulty to LOW. But if you are really brave, try HIGH mode!

Have fun playing my game! Bye! 👋
